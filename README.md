# FLW2: U2L6, Code Along #1
Let's use what we learned about event handlers in React to complete this app.

1. Use `showAnswer` as a callback function to make the answer to the first joke appear in the console when the user clicks the first button.

2. Use state to to make the answer to the second joke appear when the user clicks the second button.

- Note: The answer is "carrot"...haha.
- Hint: You will need to use the state setter function `setJokeAnswer`.
